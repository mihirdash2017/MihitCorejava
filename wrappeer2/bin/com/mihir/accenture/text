setting.xml : https://confluence.ipttools.info/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=IECCW&title=Developer+Guidelines

In terms of next steps to get the offshore team set up for starting development: 
-	These are the developer setup confluence links which I’ve already shared during our transition sessions but just re-sending them 
o	https://confluence.ipttools.info/display/IECCW/Developer+Guidelines
o	https://confluence.ipttools.info/display/IECCW/Code+Branching+Model
o	https://confluence.ipttools.info/display/IECCW/Transition+Documentation
-	Start getting familiar with the code in fulfilment vertical ( this was covered with the walkthrough with Victor) for Generate Bundle and Record Submit screens ( currently been worked on by onshore devs). Below are the bitbucket repos you would need to go through in order to start development for ‘Manage Response’. The expectation is developers go through these along with some hands on tasks as the new journey for manage response will involve implementing same kind of framework.
o	https://bitbucket.ipttools.info/projects/FU/repos/ipt-ms-fulfillment/browse  - ie-ccw branch
o	https://bitbucket.ipttools.info/projects/FU/repos/ipt-ms-fulfillment-webui/browse - ie-ccw branch
All the build jobs in jenkins are hooked to ie-ccw branch of various projects. See below link for information on Jenkins instances for build and deploy jobs https://confluence.ipttools.info/display/IECCW/Component+Mapping%3A+Build+and+Deployment+Jenkins+servers
-	UI Overview session – this is setup for Wednesday – 8th Aug
-	Manage response functional journey overview session – this will be set up for Thursday – 9th Aug.
-	Jira setup / user stories overview – this will be setup for Thursday – 9th Aug as well .
-	Once you have access to the dev environment – this is the link - https://atlas-dev-i-ie-ccw.service.np.iptho.co.uk/Caseworking/ipt-ss-activity-management-webui/activity-list
